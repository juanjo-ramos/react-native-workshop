# Exercises
You will be implementing different animations based on the content presented.

We recommend you have the documentarion of [Animated](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated) and [LayoutAnimation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/layoutanimation) at hand.

## Exercise one: Animate adding and removing cells to / from a list
### Top to bottom animation
You need to implement [this animation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1R_7ccaP6rNx4ZGHZ5pzYlZt0yXDHkH30). Hattip to **Leigh-Ann Bartsch** for creating it and sharing it with us!
To implement it, open the `AnimatableRowView/index.tsx` file and look for the TODOs there. 
Hint: You only need to use Animated to implement this animation.

If you get stuck just ask. You also have the full solution in the `FINAL-Top-To-Bottom-Animation` branch. 

### Left to right animation
Very similar to the above but in this case, the cells would [animate from left to right](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wJ0kIPWYxrCxnlEqxUrQPi80D8LB1m2C/view?usp=sharing). Hattip to **Thom Rimmer** for creating and sharing this animation.

TODO: Comment the file and the final branch

## Exercise two: Animation on the login screen
