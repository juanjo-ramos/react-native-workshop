# Exercises
You will be implementing different animations based on the content presented.

We recommend you have the documentation of [Animated](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated) and [LayoutAnimation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/layoutanimation) at hand.

## Exercise one: Animate adding and removing cells to / from a list
Hint: You only need to use Animated to implement this animation.

### Left to right animation
For this animation, you will be implementing a simplified version of [this animation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wJ0kIPWYxrCxnlEqxUrQPi80D8LB1m2C/view?usp=sharing) were rows added to the list slide from the left. Hattip to **Thom Rimmer** for creating and sharing this animation.
To implement it, open the `SlidingRowView/index.tsx` and look for thr TODOs sections. You will need to create 2 animations: One when rows are added and another one when they're deleted.

### Top to bottom animation
You need to implement [this animation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1R_7ccaP6rNx4ZGHZ5pzYlZt0yXDHkH30). Hattip to **Leigh-Ann Bartsch** for creating it and sharing it with us!
To implement it, open the `AnimatableRowView/index.tsx` file and look for the TODOs there. 

If you get stuck just ask. You also have the full solution in the `FINAL-Exercise-One` branch. 

## Exercise two: Animation on the login screen
